== Installation

=== Get the project
You can obtain the project from github by 2 ways.

* clone the code with git:
------
git clone git@github.com:fructu/abidos_cpp.git
cd abidos_cpp/processor/
------
indexterm:[github, git]

or you can

* download a zip package:
------

unzip master.zip
cd abidos_cpp-master/processor/
------
indexterm:[unzip]
indexterm:[processor]
indexterm:[wget]

=== Make project and install
we will make the processor part of Abidos is the real core of Abidos C++:
------
cmake .
make VERBOSE=1 &> make_out.txt <1>
sudo make install
------

<1> Abidos will need this file *make_out.txt* to know what files
have to parse (Abidos can parse Abidos because is a C++ Project).
indexterm:[cmake]
indexterm:[make]

you can test it with the abidos itself:
------
abidos_make_process.pl <1>
------

<1> this script do all the toolchain that abidos need for you.

This command encapsulates the toolchain of Abidos (it will be explained in next
chapters).
