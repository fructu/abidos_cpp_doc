== Abidos parsing

=== The easy way passing one C++ file

If your entire C++ project is only one file you can show his UML diagram in this 
way.

----
abidos --out_dir . <file.cpp>
xdot_run.py files_output.dot
----

Some projects need pass the directories where includes are :

.passing includes directory
=====
----
abidos --includes includes/ --out_dir . t034.cpp
----
=====

[NOTE]
=====
The includes issue is like when you pass it to gcc or g+ compiler, see how you
compile your project and you will know how invoke Abidos as well.
=====

indexterm:[include]

=== The easy way parsing a set of C++ files

Normally you will want parse all the files of a whole C++ project.

In order to parse a whole project you will need a make process with his
Makefile.

Within Abidos package you have installed *abidos_make_process.pl*, this script
analyzes the output of a *make process*, is the most straight method to
obtain a UML diagram browsable.
indexterm:[abidos_make_process.pl]
indexterm:[make process]

It is possible to do this operations by hand, but first we should learn the 
easy way.

The easy way to execute Abidos is enter in a C++ project directory, and do:
----
cd <cpp_project>
make clean
make VERBOSE=1 &> make_out.txt <1>
abidos_make_process.pl
----
<1> Abidos needs to know what files needs to parse, and all files of a project
are in the output of a make process.

=== The hacker way Abidos toolchain explanation

When you are going to parse a C++ project with Abidos, you need a special
directory called *.abidos/* in the same directory you have the *Makefile*.

In order to work properly and parse successfully a C++ project abidos need be
loaded with the file *.abidos/files_input*, in this file each line is like:

----
/home/.../src/main.cpp:/home/.../includes:/home/.../src
/home/.../src/file1.cpp:/home/.../includes:/home/.../src
----

[NOTE]
====
"..." is to do not make more bloat the example.
====

Those lines begin with a cpp file and are followed by some directories separated
by *:* symbol in this directories is where abidos search for a includes files.

Once abidos have parsed the whole project:

* All the files in *.abidos/files_input*.
* The files includes in those cpp files.

It generates *.abidos/files_output.dot* which is a file in graphviz
indexterm:[graphviz] format.
  footnote:[graphviz http://www.graphviz.org/ a superb project to generate and
  visualize graphs]

Now with *xdot_run.py* based in xdot.py project
  footnote:[xdot.py http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot with a little
  hacking of my own http://code.google.com/p/xdot-multi-line] you can look
  *.abidos/files_output.dot* graphviz indexterm:[graphviz] format.
  indexterm:[xdot.py]
  indexterm:[xdot_run.py]
  indexterm:[file_output.dot]

you will see a navigable window with a UML diagram of the C++ project.

*abidos_make_process.pl* would do all this things for you, but for now there is
a lot of remaining work to do in this script:

* Analyzes *make_out.txt* and generates *.abidos/files_input*, it works when the
  output of make process is like:

----
  cd /home/.../src && /usr/bin/c++        \
  -Wall -c -g -I/home/.../includes/       \
    -o CMakeFiles/abidos.dir/main.cpp.o   \
    -c /home/.../src/main.cpp
----

  this line have been extracted from the make process of abidos itself, the
  Makefile have obtained from "cmake ." process.

indexterm:[cmake]

* It searches -c options to extract the cpp files.

* It searches -I options to extract the includes directories.

* It adds the directory of the cpp file too.

This figure shows the whole process:

image::images/chapter_abidos_parsing_abidos_flow_diagram_01.{eps_svg}[align="center"]

to summarize the different parts of abidos have worked in the previous figure
are:

* make_out.txt, is the output of make process.
  indexterm:[make_out.txt]
* abidos_make_process.pl parses the make_out.txt and generates
  .abidos/files_input and executes abidos and xdot_run.py
* abidos load the cpp files from *.abidos/files_input* then generates
* .abidos/file_output.dot*, this file has dot format.
* xdot_run.py load *.abidos/file_output.dot* and show you to browse through the
  UML diagram.
  indexterm:[xdot.py]
  indexterm:[xdot_run.py]
  indexterm:[file_output.dot]
  indexterm:[UML]

When you have .abidos/file_output.dot generated you can launch the UML diagram
whenever you want doing:

----
  xdot_run.py/file_output.dot
----

[NOTE]
====
If you modified a C++ source file you would need to execute all the toolchain to
 see the new changes.
====

Now you have a deep knowledge about the abidos toolchain you can generate some
parts of the toolchain by hand o by a script. You can write .abidos/files_input
as you wish or you can comment some lines with *#* to drop some files from abidos
parsing process.

You can invoke abidos to process .abidos/files_input
----
  abidos --out_dir .abidos --loader .abidos/files_input <1>
----
<1> you can check if abidos worked looking if files_output.dot has been
generated
----
    ls .abidos/
    files_input  files_output.dot
----

You can visualize the output of abidos
----
  xdot_run.py .abidos/files_output.dot
----
